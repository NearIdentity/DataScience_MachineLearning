2) Find the impact of weather on trips and bike share usage.
3) Create a simple application that predicts the duration of a trip given the start station, the end station and the time of the day.
5) HackBikeShareTO-CycleApp.csv is an extra dataset with granular trip information from a smart phone app. Inspect the dataset and come up with strategies to extract business insights from the data.
